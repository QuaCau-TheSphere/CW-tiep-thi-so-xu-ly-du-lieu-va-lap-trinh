To fully answer "Why learn PureScript?" we must answer three other questions:

- Why one should use Javascript to build programs...
- ...but not write Javascript to build it...
- ...and write Purescript instead of alternatives

Developers didn't want to use a new language, they wanted to use an existing language. When TS arrived, people were trying to build Node and Browser software with JavaScript, which meant there was a lot of existing codebases out there, and re-writing them all to be Dart was infeasible. TS won out because it is a superset of JavaScript, which means all those existing codebases could be enhanced by TypeScript, it was very low impact.
